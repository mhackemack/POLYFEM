You read this file because you have successfully downloaded and
uncompress the package.

Assumed you did this in directory /MYDIR
(for instance, your home directory)
This created a directory /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca and the present file is
/MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/README

You will find the documentation in /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Doc/
(a userguide giving additional information and a related paper).

Fortran 90
----------

The userguide refers to two examples (one sequential and one parallel).
The related sources are located in /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Example_seq/
and /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Example_par/, respectively. There you will find also
a Makefile allowing their compilation entering the command "make".
You possibly need to edit the Makefile to correct the name of the
compiler and set your favorite compilation options, while updating
the references to needed external libraries (see below for details)
according to your local installation setting.

In fact, these Makefile just make sure that the application program
is compiled together with the proper sources files in SRC/ ,
while needed external libraries are referenced.
You may proceed in a similar way with any application program.
(Hence, AGMG need not be installed as a library).

Note, however, that the Makefile also avoids recompiling dagmg.f90
dagmg_mumps.f90 or dagmg_par.f90 when only the application program
has been changed. This is strongly recommended. In particular,
the compilation of dagmg_mumps.f90 is time consuming.

The provided examples use the double precision version. To use the
single, complex or double complex version, proceed similarly
exchanging in the file the prefix "d" for, respectively, "s", "c" or "z".

AGMG requires LAPACK and BLAS libraries. These software are public domain
and easily found on the Web, see the userguide for references. In addition,
LAPACK and BLAS come pre-installed with most compilers.
If you don't have LAPACK pre-installed, you may compile, instead of downloading
the full library, the file SRC/lapack_agmg.f together with other program
files. This will provide needed LAPACK routines. Similarly, if you don't
have BLAS pre-installed, you may compile, instead of downloading
the full library, the file SRC/blas_agmg.f together with other program
files. This will provide needed BLAS routines. We however strongly
recommend to use pre-installed libraries whenever available.

In addition, the parallel version requires MPI and the parallel MUMPS library,
which itself requires SCALAPACK. These software are also public domain;
see the userguide for references. Note that the installation of the
parallel MUMPS library may be avoided by upgrading to the professional
version.


Matlab
------

Files for the Matlab interface are located in directory /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Matlab/

The user interface is in the file agmg.m (Matlab function)
Enter "help agmg" in the Matlab environment for basic usage.
A more detailed description of optional parameters and of
verbose output is provided in the userguide in /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Doc/
(see in particular Sections 2.2 and 2.4, and also Sections 4 and 5
for some special usages)

The function in agmg.m need the objects dmtlagmg.mex??? (for real matrices)
and zmtlagmg.mex??? (for complex matrices), where ??? depends upon your OS
and architecture. Currently, we provide precompiled objects for Unix 64 bit,
Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Mac OS 64 bit architectures
If you have one of these architectures, all what you need to run agmg is to
place the files agmg.m and ?mtlagmg.mex??? in a directory in which Matlab can
find scripts & executables.

Note however that, for Windows and Mac OS, we did not use the compilers
officially supported by Matlab, hence the function is possibly sub-performant
(10 to 15 % slower) and may be unstable when used with the optional
parameter IJOB set different from default.

You can anyway generate the objects dmtlagmg.mex??? and zmtlagmg.mex???
with the commands

mex -O -largeArrayDims dmtlagmg.c dagmg_mex.f90 dagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -O -largeArrayDims zmtlagmg.c zagmg_mex.f90 zagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas

on 64 bit architectures, and with the commands

mex -O dmtlagmg.c dagmg_mex.f90 dagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -O zmtlagmg.c zagmg_mex.f90 zagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas

on 32 bit architectures.
(Below are given some more details on how to proceed on Windows systems).

Besides, we also provide in the file agtwolev.m a Matlab function
that only performs aggregation according to the algorithm in
either [2] or [3]. This is not intended to help solving linear systems,
but rather to facilitate further research and developments.
Enter "help agtwolev" in the matlab environment for more details
on function usage, which allows to easily play with the parameters
referenced in [2,3].

This function requires the object dmtlagtwolev.mex???. If you don't
find a precompiled version for your architecture, you can generate it
with the command

mex -O -largeArrayDims dmtlagtwolev.c dagtwolev_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas

on 64 bit architectures, and with the commands

mex -O dmtlagtwolev.c dagtwolev_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas

on 32 bit architectures.

Release notes
-------------
See the userguide in /MYDIR/AGMG_3.2.3-aca/Doc/ (in particular Section 1.2)
for a description of changes from previous releases.

Matlab on Windows system: detailed compilation procedure
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Install a Fortran compiler that is compatible with Matlab's mex command;
   there should be also a compatible C compiler;
   e.g, "Intel Visual Fortran 12.0" with "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010".

2. At the Matlab prompt, run "mex -setup" to select the Fortran compiler
   ("Intel Visual Fortran 12.0" in the above example) and tell the directory
   where it is installed.

3. Once the Fortran compiler is configured with Matlab, you can test it on one
   of the Matlab Fortran/MEX examples they provide.

4. Next, to compile the AGMG code, you must first compile the Fortran files
into object files (.obj).  Run this at the Matlab prompt:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mex -largeArrayDims -c  COMPFLAGS="$COMPFLAGS -free"  LINKFLAGS="$LINKFLAGS ...
    -nofor_main" dagmg_mex.f90 dagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -largeArrayDims -c  COMPFLAGS="$COMPFLAGS -free"  LINKFLAGS="$LINKFLAGS ...
     -nofor_main" zagmg_mex.f90 zagmg_mumps_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -largeArrayDims -c  COMPFLAGS="$COMPFLAGS -free"  LINKFLAGS="$LINKFLAGS ...
     -nofor_main" dagtwolev_mex.f90 -lmwlapack -lmwblas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Omit -largeArrayDims option on 32 bit systems).

5. Next, you need to rerun "mex -setup" to select the associated C compiler
   ("Microsoft Visual C++ 2010" in the above example).

6. Open "dmtlagmg.c" and rename "dagmg_" to "DAGMG", with NO underscore;
   this appears in two places.  This is because Visual Fortran on Windows
   uses all CAPS without underscores for function names.  Similarly, open
   "zmtlagmg.c" and rename "zagmg_" to "ZAGMG", with NO underscore; this
   appears in two places.  Lastly, open "dmtlagtwolev.c" and rename
   "dag2l_twolev_" to "DAG2L_TWOLEV", with NO underscore; this appears
   in two places.

7.  Now, link everything together with the following mex commands
   (thus using now the C compiler - see 5. above):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mex -O -v -largeArrayDims dmtlagmg.c dagmg_mex.obj dagmg_mumps_mex.obj ...
   -L"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE 2011 SP1\compiler\lib\intel64" ...
   -lifconsol -llibifcoremd -llibifportmd -llibmmd -llibirc -lsvml_dispmd ...
   -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -O -v -largeArrayDims zmtlagmg.c zagmg_mex.obj zagmg_mumps_mex.obj ...
  -L"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE 2011 SP1\compiler\lib\intel64" ...
  -lifconsol -llibifcoremd -llibifportmd -llibmmd -llibirc -lsvml_dispmd ...
  -lmwlapack -lmwblas
mex -O -v -largeArrayDims dmtlagtwolev.c dagtwolev_mex.obj ...
  -L"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE 2011 SP1\compiler\lib\intel64" ...
  -lifconsol -llibifcoremd -llibifportmd -llibmmd -llibirc -lsvml_dispmd ...
  -lmwlapack -lmwblas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In these example,
-L"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE 2011 SP1\compiler\lib\intel64"
tells the compiler where to find additional Fortran libraries, and
-lifconsol -llibifcoremd -llibifportmd -llibmmd -llibirc -lsvml_dispmd
reference that libraries.
These options have to be adapted to your particular installation.

Miscellaneous:  the reason for the two compile steps is because Matlab
in Windows does not allow you to have two compilers (C++ and Fortran)
work with the "mex" command simultaneously.  Thus, you must do a pre-compile
step first for the Fortran only files, then finish everything up with the
C compiler because the mex Gateway Function (mexFunction) is in a C file.
And this last step requires you to tell the C compiler where the necessary
Fortran libraries are.
